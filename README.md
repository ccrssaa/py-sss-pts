# py-sss-pts

Python implementation of
[Solid State Storage (SSS) Performance Test Specification (PTS)](https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/pts)

**Be careful, test will destroy all data on the device under test**

Tested with:
- lspci version 3.5.6
- lshw version B.02.19.2
- nvme version 1.10
- fio 3.23

–êll utilities mentioned above must be installed

Currently only IOPS test

Supports NVMe only (tested with Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 500GB)

Sudo must be configured to allow lspci, lshw, nvme, fio without password:
```
# cat /etc/sudoers.d/vadim 
vadim ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/fio,/usr/sbin/nvme,/usr/sbin/lshw,/sbin/lspci
```
